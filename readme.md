# DinoAI

### About

This is a program I made to learn to play Google Chrome's dinosaur game.
It evolves using NeAT and is made using Python and Pygame.

### Installation
For dependency management, this project uses `pipenv`, which can be installed with `python -m pip install pipenv`
After that, simply install all dependencies with `pipenv install`

### Usage

To run, enter `pipenv run python neat.py` followed by any switches.

This program can be run from the command line with the option switches:
  - -d/--debug: Print additional information about each generation
  - -q/--quiet: Don't create a screen or draw anything to it

Enjoy.
