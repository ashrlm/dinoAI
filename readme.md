# DinoAI

### About

This is a program I made to learn to play Google Chrome's dinosaur game.
It evolves using NeAT and is made using Python and Pygame, which can be installed running `pip install pygame` from the command line.

### Usage

This program can be run from the command line with the option switches:
  - -d/--debug: Print additional information about each generation
  - -q/--quiet: Don't create a screen or draw anything to it

Enjoy.
