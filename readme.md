So, this is just a cool thing I saw online and decided to try recreate.
I know my codes really ugly but... so what? Anyways this is an implementation
of NeAT, which... just read the paper on it. Feel free to do whatever you want
with this, but I'm honestly just using GitHub to backup my code, and cause
I really need a profile.
